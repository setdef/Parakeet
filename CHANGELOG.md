# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Test results in the IDE's test runner: each test file and test with pass/fail, failures with expected and actual values (Click to see difference), jumping to a test's source, and running a single test from the tree. Tests build in a mirror of the project in the IDE's system directory, so nothing is added to the project.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-22

### Added

- Quick documentation (F1 or hover): a definition's signature, where it's defined, and its doc comment.
- Inko types, traits, methods, and constants in Go to Class, Go to Symbol, and Search Everywhere.
- A Structure view, breadcrumbs, and sticky lines for each file's types, traits, impls, methods, fields, and constants.
- Code folding for blocks, comment runs, and imports.
- Completion for keywords, names in scope, module paths and symbols in imports, members after `.`, and fields after `@`.
- Live templates: `fn`, `fnp`, `type`, `typep`, `trait`, `impl`, `match`, `main`, `tests`, and `test`.
- TODO and FIXME highlighting in comments, and the TODO tool window.
- Spell checking in comments and strings.

### Fixed

- Go to definition landed on doc comments, or the top of the file for built-in types like `String`.
- Reformat Code did nothing for Inko files that weren't saved to disk.
